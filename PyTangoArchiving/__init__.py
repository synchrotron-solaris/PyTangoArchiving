Methods from ArchivingManager:
5 - ArchivingStartHdb

    * Description: Start an historic archiving of several attributes, with a mode.
       
    * Argin:
      DEVVAR_STRINGARRAY : Archiving arguments...

              o The first part :
                    + argin[0] = the load balancing type of the archiving
                      "1", if all the attribute are archived together in the same TdbArchiver device,
                      "0" otherwise.
                    + argin[1] = the number of attributes to archive
                    + argin[2] to argin [2 + argin[1] - 1] = the name of each attribute 
              o The second part (the Mode part) :
                Let us note "index" the last index used (for example, at this point, index = 2]).
                    + If the Mode is composed of a Periodical Mode
                      argin[index+ 1] = MODE_P
                      argin[index+ 2] = the period of the periodic mode in (ms)
                      index = index + 2
                    + If the Mode is composed of an Absolute Mode
                      argin[index+ 1] = MODE_A
                      argin[index+ 2] = the frequency of the absolute mode in (ms)
                      argin[index+ 3] = the delta value max when decreasing
                      argin[index+ 4] = the delta value max when increasing
                      index = index + 4
                    + If the Mode is composed of a Relative Mode
                      argin[index+ 1] = MODE_R
                      argin[index+ 2] = the frequency of the relative mode in (ms)
                      argin[index+ 3] = the decreasing variation associated to this mode
                      argin[index+ 4] = the increasing variation associated to this mode
                      index = index + 4
                    + If the Mode is composed of an Threshold Mode
                      argin[index+ 1] = MODE_T
                      argin[index+ 2] = the frequency of the threshold mode in (ms)
                      argin[index+ 3] = the smallest value (min) when decreasing
                      argin[index+ 4] = the biggest value (max) when increasing
                      index = index + 4
                    + If the Mode is composed of a On Calculation Mode
                      argin[index+ 1] = MODE_C
                      argin[index+ 2] = the frequency of the on calculation mode in (ms)
                      argin[index+ 3] = the number of values taken into account
                      argin[index+ 4] = the type associated to this mode
                      argin[index+ 5] = Not used at the moment
                      index = index + 5
                    + If the Mode is composed of an On Difference Mode
                      argin[index+ 1] = MODE_D
                      argin[index+ 2] = the frequency of this mode (in ms)
                      index = index + 2
                    + If the Mode is composed of an External Mode
                      argin[index+ 1] = MODE_E
                      index = index + 1

15 - GetStatusHdb

    * Description: For each attribute of the given list, get the status of the device in charge of its historical archiving
       
    * Argin:
      DEVVAR_STRINGARRAY : The attribute list.
       
    * Argout:
      DEVVAR_STRINGARRAY : The list of status.
       
    * Command allowed for:

      DEVVAR_STRINGARRAY : The applied mode...

              o Let us note "index" the last index used (for example, at this point, index = 0]). If the Mode is composed of a Periodical Mode
